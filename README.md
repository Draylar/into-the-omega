*Into the Omega* is a small End-expansion mod. It's primary mechanic is Ω Enchantments, which allow you to limit-break standard vanilla enchantments into more powerful versions.

To start, you'll need to find *Ω Crystal Ore* in the end. These generate in clusters of up to 8 ores at any y level. They drop *Ω Crystals*, which are the primary material of the mod.

After obtaining a bit of Crystals, you can craft a Conquest Forge:

The Conquest Forge can be used to upgrade Enchantment books. The UI is as follows:

Omega Crystals go in the top, max level enchanted books go in the side. 2 vanilla Enchantment books that are max level will result in a level 1 Omega Enchanted Book:

This is the functional equivelant of Sharpness 6. Can you create the very best tools?
