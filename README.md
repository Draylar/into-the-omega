*Into the Omega* is a small End-expansion mod. It's primary mechanic is Ω Enchantments, which allow you to limit-break standard vanilla enchantments into more powerful versions.

To start, you'll need to find *Ω Crystal Ore* in the end. These generate in clusters of up to 8 ores at any y level. They drop *Ω Crystals*, which are the primary material of the mod.
