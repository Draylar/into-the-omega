The End rejects you, but for what cause? The truth may be hidden far past this eclipse...

### Meta


*Into the Omega* is a major RPG End-expansion mod inspired by [Terraria](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Terraria_Wiki), [Calamity Mod](https://calamitymod.fandom.com/wiki/Calamity_Mod_Wiki), and past RPG mods in Minecraft. It introduces a plethora of new bosses, items, mechanics, loot, dungeons, & adventures for you to explore. 

ITO makes several drastic changes to how the End generates, which currently leaves it incompatible with other End-biome adding mods.
Support for these projects can be added upon request once ITO leaves an alpha state.

Warning: ITO is in heavy alpha. If you use it in a world now, there is a 100% chance something will break in a future update.
Use alpha versions of this mod at your own risk and take backups frequently.

### License

This branch's license is TBD, which means it is ARR until further notice. The license will most likely end up being MIT or Apache 2.0 after an alpha release.
